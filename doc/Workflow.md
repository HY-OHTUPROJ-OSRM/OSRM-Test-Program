# Agile Playbook

## Scrum Meetings

This project will have 5 types of re-occurring meetings during sprints.

### Daily Scrum

Purpose of this meeting is to share information with team members and stay informed. Facilitated by the Agile Coach. The daily scrum meeting is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant subgroup immediately after the meeting.

During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your or your team's way to reach the sprint goals?

### Sprint Planning

Purpose of this meeting is to plan work to be performed in the Sprint. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. The meeting is facilitated by the Agile Coach.

### Sprint Review

Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment with the Customer and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. The meeting is facilitated by the Agile Coach.

### Sprint Retrospective

Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and recognize improvements to be taken into use during the next Sprint.

During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:

- What went well in the Sprint
- What could be improved
- What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint

### Backlog Refinement

Purpose of this meeting is to make improvements to the Product Backlog.

A Backlog Refinement session can be used to:

- Write user stories
- Break down user stories that are too big and improve user stories that are poorly written
- Estimate backlog items
- Add acceptance criteria
- Look deeper into the backlog to do longer-range technical planning

## Sprint Goal or Vision

Sprint goals should be created for each sprint to clarify to all team members what the sprint is planning to reach at the end of the sprint. The Sprint goal should be specific and measurable.

You may use the following template to create the sprint goals:

### GOAL

- Why do we run this sprint?
- What must we achieve? Fix bugs? Enhance features? Deliver a feature? Prototype?

### METHOD

- How do we demonstrate that the goal was met?
- What is the technique or test case that will be used to evidence success?
- UAT results or user/stakeholder satisfaction query?

### METRICS

- What is the Definition of Done criteria for the goal?
- E.g., numeric improvement in performance?
- UAT acceptance target figure.

## Story Points

Description of how team(s) define story points.

> Agile teams use story points and ‘estimating poker’ to value their work. A story point is a singular number that represents a combination of qualities:
> 
> - Volume – How much is there?
> - Complexity – How hard is it?
> - Knowledge – What’s known?
> - Uncertainty – What’s unknown?
> 
> Story points are relative, without a connection to any specific unit of measure. The size (effort) of each story is estimated relative to the smallest story, which is assigned a size of ‘one.’ A modified Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100) is applied that reflects the inherent uncertainty in estimating, especially large numbers (e.g., 20, 40, 100).
